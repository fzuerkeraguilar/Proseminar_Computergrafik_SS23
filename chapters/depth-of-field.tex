\chapter{Depth-of-Field}

\section{Accumulation buffers}
The image is rendered multiple times.
Each time shifting the virtual camera to simulate the circle of confusion (CoC).
The image around the point on which the camera is pointed moves very little thus creating very little blur.
The image far away from the focus point differ wildly and therefore are very blurred.
Workload is increased n-fold. Converges to correct answer

\section{2.5 dimensional rendering}
Render background blurred.
Render objects in focus.
Render foreground blurred.

Object can't go between layers.
background and foreground are uniformly blurred, without variation with distance.

\section{Backwards depth mapping}
z-buffer is generated with image.

Simple form: Each pixel is blurred according to distance from focus plane.
But: Generates unrealistic result at the boundaries of object with far background.

Complex form: Split image into n sub-images, culling pixels not in same "plane".
Culled pixels are disoccluded with chosen method and each sub-image is blurred according to distance to focus distance.
Images are combined to create final image.
