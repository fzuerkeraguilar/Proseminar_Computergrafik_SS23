%% ===========================
Typically added to indicate high brightness to viewer as most monitors do not support a high enough dynamic range to display bright scenes correctly.

The image position of a light source is mirrored at the middle of the frame and the texture is placed there.
The size and opaqueness of the texture increase as they move toward the center of the frame.
