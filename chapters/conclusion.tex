\chapter{Conclusion and future work}
This paper presents a variety of techniques to simulate both motion blur and \gls{dof} in real-time applications.
Even though these techniques are approximations, they offer a considerable improvement to the realism and artistic control over the generated images.

We described the underlying physical phenomena and how each method approximates tries to approximate them.
Additionally we compared methods based on their performance and image quality.
As we have seen, there is always a trade-off between image accuracy and performance of methods.
Although for real-time applications simple methods are often enough, as each image only appears very briefly to the user.

The proliferation of real-time ray-tracing hardware and supporting applications offer opportunities for more realistic effects.
